          The sole purpose of Gamer-Date is to help players, age 18 and older, build communities and meet friends, not to search for romantic partners or sexual relationships.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Just be genuinely you. Don&apos;t create a fake account or pretend to be someone you&apos;re not, even if it&apos;s just for fun.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Communicate Respectfully. Talking to new people can be tricky. Respect goes a long way.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Consider boundaries. Comfort levels vary person to person. We don&apos;t allow nudity, sexual content, sexual desires, or looking for sex on your public profile. If you are in a private conversation, these are okay if everyone is okay with it. Consent matters.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Share cautiously and thoughtfully. Don’t publicly broadcast your personal information or ways for people to connect with you (no public displays of things like phone numbers, emails, or social handles). Don’t ask others to send you their personal details either.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          We aim to promote positivity and won’t tolerate any sort of violent content that contains gore, death, images or descriptions of violent acts (against humans or animals), use of weapons, and anything advocating for or glorifying self-harm.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Make personal connections, not business ones. Don’t advertise, promote, share your social handles to only gain followers, sell stuff, fundraise, or campaign.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          This is not a place to advertise for sex work.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Harassment, threats, bullying, intimidation, extortion, blackmail, or anything intentionally done to cause harm is not allowed.

          Gamer Date is not a place for hate. We will never stand behind racism, bigotry, hatred, or violence based on who someone is, how they identify or what they look like. This includes (but not limited to) someone&apos;s race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability, physicality, gender, gender identity, age, national origin, or sexual orientation. If you see someone who doesn&apos;t meet your personal criteria, don&apos;t &quot;like&quot; them or &quot;unmatch&quot; and move on.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Adults only. You must be 18 years of age or older to use Gamer Date. This also means we don&apos;t allow photos of unaccompanied or unclothed minors, including photos of your younger self, no matter how adorable you were back then.
        </li>
        <li className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
          Abide by the law. No illegal content or activities are allowed, ever. This means you can&apos;t use Gamer date to buy or sell drugs or counterfeit goods, or ask for assistance to help you break the law. We definitely won&apos;t tolerate anyone using Gamer Date to advocate or participate in any sort of harm involving minors or human trafficking.
